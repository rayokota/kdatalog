# KDatalog - Kafka as a Datalog Engine

KDatalog is a distributed Datalog engine using Apache Kafka.  It is implemented as a Pregel algorithm in [Kafka Graphs](https://github.com/rayokota/kafka-graphs), and is adapted from the Apache Giraph implementation of Datalog on Pregel from the work "Parallel Datalog on Pregel" by Matthias Maiterth.
